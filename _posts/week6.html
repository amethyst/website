<h2 id='notable_additions'>Notable additions</h2>

<ul>
<li>A 2013 presentation titled Bitsquid: Behind The Scenes has been added to the list of design inspiration documents. It covers a variety of topics, namely data-oriented design, job parallelism, rapid game development, and lessons learned from the game industry. Huge thanks to engine developer <a href='https://twitter.com/niklasfrykholm'>@niklasfrykholm</a> of Autodesk for making this summary!</li>

<li>Implementation of the user-facing API of <code>amethyst_ecs</code> has begun. This brings us one step closer to merging the ECS game framework into the mainline. Join the discussion on engine issue <a href='https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst/issues/10'>#10</a>.</li>

<p>Draft 2.0 of the renderer diagram was published to master this week. The design has been simplified considerably with the elimination of intermediate representation (IR) from the renderer, originally conceived for providing network transparency and tool slaving capabilities. This responsibility has been moved upward to the engine level, allowing for things like SFM-style demo record and replay and other goodies. Please leave your thoughts on engine issue <a href='https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst/issues/19'>#19</a>.</p>

<p>Some meta-news: starting next issue, TWIA's release schedule will shift from every Monday to every Sunday. This is to get our newsletter in sync with <a href='https://this-week-in-rust.org/'>This Week in Rust</a> so readers aren't stuck reading last week's post every time. Hopefully this will make things more convenient in the long run</p>
